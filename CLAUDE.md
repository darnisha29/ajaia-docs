# Ajaia Docs — Claude / agent instructions

This project follows five strict conventions. Full versions live in `.cursor/rules/` and apply to
both Claude Code and Cursor.

## 1. Arrow functions (strict)

**Always use arrow function syntax** in TypeScript and React code. Do not introduce `function`
declarations for components, helpers, hooks, or utilities. See
[`.cursor/rules/arrow-functions.mdc`](.cursor/rules/arrow-functions.mdc).

| Use                                | Avoid                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `export const Foo = () => { ... }` | `export function Foo() { ... }` |
| `const Bar = (x: T) => ...`        | `function Bar(x: T) { ... }`    |

Exceptions are rare: only when arrow syntax is invalid (e.g. generators) or a minimal patch must
match existing `function` style in the same file.

## 2. Folder structure (strict)

Organize `src/` by responsibility (`app/`, `components/{ui,common,<feature>}`, `sections/`, `hooks/`,
`lib/`, `utils/`, `providers/`, `constants/`, `data/`, `styles/`) and import via the `@/*`
alias. See [`.cursor/rules/folder-structure.mdc`](.cursor/rules/folder-structure.mdc).

## 3. Code optimization (strict)

Reuse existing utils/hooks/components before adding new ones, keep functions small, remove dead code,
and let Prettier own formatting (no semicolons, double quotes, single JSX attribute per line). See
[`.cursor/rules/code-optimization.mdc`](.cursor/rules/code-optimization.mdc).

## 4. One component per file (strict)

**Every `.tsx` file contains exactly one React component.** Never define multiple components in the
same file. If a component needs sub-components (cards, rows, toolbars, etc.), extract each into its
own file and import it. Group a section's sub-components in a subfolder next to it (e.g.
`sections/DocumentEditor/editor/`). Non-component code (types, constants, data, hooks, utility
functions, CVA/`cva` variant definitions) may live in its own non-`.tsx` file or co-located. See
[`.cursor/rules/folder-structure.mdc`](.cursor/rules/folder-structure.mdc).

| Use                                               | Avoid                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `DocumentEditor.tsx` + `editor/EditorToolbar.tsx` | `DocumentEditor.tsx` defining 8 components |

## 5. Database migrations (strict)

Supabase Postgres, accessed through the Supabase JS client (`@supabase/supabase-js`) — the
server-only admin client lives in [`src/lib/supabase.ts`](src/lib/supabase.ts) and authorization is
handled in app code (see [`src/lib/permissions.ts`](src/lib/permissions.ts)), not Supabase RLS.
**Every schema change ships as a forward-only SQL migration** under `supabase/migrations/`, and **an
already-applied migration is never edited or deleted** — to change it, add a new migration that moves
the state forward. Keep the hand-maintained types in
[`src/lib/database.types.ts`](src/lib/database.types.ts) in sync. See
[`.cursor/rules/database-migrations.mdc`](.cursor/rules/database-migrations.mdc).

Migration files are named `<14-digit UTC timestamp>_<description>.sql` — `supabase db push` silently
skips files without that prefix. Use `supabase migration new <name>` to generate one.

| Use                                                    | Avoid                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| New `supabase/migrations/20260812120300_add_field.sql` | Editing an applied migration `.sql` by hand |
| New forward migration to undo a change                 | Deleting an applied migration to redo it    |

## Project-specific notes

- **Auth is deliberately lightweight.** Seeded users + an httpOnly signed session cookie
  ([`src/lib/session.ts`](src/lib/session.ts)). This is a scoped exercise decision, documented in
  `ARCHITECTURE.md` — do not reach for a full auth provider without asking.
- **Every document read/write goes through a permission check.** Never query the `documents` table
  from a route without resolving access via [`src/lib/permissions.ts`](src/lib/permissions.ts).
- **All HTML that enters the database is sanitized server-side**
  ([`src/lib/sanitize.ts`](src/lib/sanitize.ts)) — imported files and editor content alike. Client-side
  sanitization is not a substitute.
